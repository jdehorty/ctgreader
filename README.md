CTG Opening Book Reader
========================

The goal is to make a simple chess opening book reader that can read the CTG format. The code of Aaron Becker from the daydreamer chess project (http://github.com/AaronBecker/daydreamer) is used as a starting point.

1. For now, run "make".
2. Then execute "ctg_reader <ctg book file> <fen>". You will get JSON output on the search results.
